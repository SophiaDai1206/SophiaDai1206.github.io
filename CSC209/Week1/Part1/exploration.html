        <h1>Whale Behavior & Communication</h1>
        <p>Whales are intelligent and social creatures, known for their unique behaviors, incredible communication skills, and vital role in marine ecosystems.</p>

        <h2>üêã Unique Whale Behaviors</h2>
        <p>Whales exhibit a variety of fascinating behaviors, such as breaching (jumping out of the water), spy-hopping (peeking above the surface), and lobtailing (slapping their tails on the water). These actions may serve as forms of communication, play, or even hunting techniques.</p>

        <h2>üîä Communication Among Whales</h2>
        <p>Whales use songs, clicks, and body movements** to communicate. Some species, like humpback whales, create complex songs that can travel vast distances underwater. These vocalizations play a crucial role in navigation, mating, and social bonding.</p>

        <h2>üåç Their Role in Marine Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>As ocean ecosystem engineers, whales help regulate marine life populations and contribute to ocean health. Their movements distribute nutrients throughout the water, and their carcasses provide food for deep-sea organisms, supporting biodiversity.</p>

        <h2>üåä Protecting These Gentle Giants</h2>
        <p>Despite their importance, whales face threats such as climate change, plastic pollution, and ship strikes. Conservation efforts, marine protected areas, and responsible whale-watching help ensure their survival.</p>
